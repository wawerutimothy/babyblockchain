Implementation of a simplified blockchain 
is implemented by python programming language. It takes on the the bitcoin protocol
and is able to mine a block and pass it as a json dump to the browser through the flask,
a python lightweight framework.
Through the secrets module, we are able to generate a secure private key.
Once a private key is generated, it cannot be repeated once it's run again, similar to a block.
proof of work concept makes it progressively hard for the user from modifying previous blocks.
